Installation
============

Run the portable bootstrap script:

    ./bootstrap.py

Add shared python and django packages and modules:

    cd local/share
    ln -s ~/django/share django
    ln -s ~/python/share python

Currently, there are some dependencies resolved by this. In future, when
the apps are more fleshed out, they'll be included in requirements.pip
