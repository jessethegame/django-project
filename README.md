Django Project
==============

A Django project template

Project expects a top-level directory named 'local'. This folder and its
structure is created by 'bootstrap.py', either within the project by
default, or symlinking a given location.


Installation
============

Run the portable bootstrap script:

    ./bootstrap.py

Add shared python and django packages and modules by symlinking to their
containing folders in `local/share`.
